		<p class="question">Why are your taking this course?</p>
		<p class="answer">This course is an elective for the Math for Teaching program at the Harvard Extension School. While I have experience with developing dynamic web applications, I do not have experience with PHP or Git. This is a great opportunity to learn some new skills and refresh some old ones.</p>
		
		<p class="question">What previous experience do you have with programming?</p>
		<p class="answer">I have experience with programming in .NET (C# and VB), Java, PeopleCode (an Oracle/PeopleSoft language similar to Java), PowerShell, JavaScript, and SQL. Over the years, I've been exposed to many programming languages and frameworks, but my primary focus has been Windows development.  I've used SVN and TFS for source control.</p>
		
		<p class="question">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</p>
		<p class="answer">For this class, I created a virtual machine running Windows 7. My host OS is Windows 7.</p>
		
		<p class="question">Anything else we should know?</p>
		<p class="answer">Server management is not one of my greatest skills, and my Unix CL experience is limited to managing an SVN server on RedHat. It's not a primary focus of this class, but one of my goals is to get better at managing LAMP environments. I'll be looking for ways to practice this throughout the semester, and I might try to switch to a Linux OS for one of the later projects.</p>
