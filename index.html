    <!-- wrap the entire body contents in a div
         the bootstrap "container" class will handle the fixed-width, centered layout
         this style rule will center the content by applying a fixed width to the div and using an "auto" left/right margin -->
    <div class="container">
    
        <!-- the bootstrap grid system uses the "row" class as a container for columns
             this class handles the necessary margin, padding, and clear rules needed for the floated columns -->
        <div class="row">
        
            <!-- the first row consists of two columns:
                
                   3-col              9-col
                 +~~~~~~~+ +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 | photo | |         content         |
                 +~~~~~~~+ +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                
                 this is easily achieved by using the following html:
                 <div class="col-sm-3">photo</div>
                 <div class="col-sm-9">content</div>
                
                 the challenge here is that we don't want the photo to be semantically first on the page
                 this is less important for this page, but may be critical in an application that has a more sophisticated design
                
                 so, we can change it by putting the markup in the correct order, and then pushing/pulling the columns into position as follows:
                 <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-push-3">content</div>
                 <div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-pull-9">photo</div>
                
                 the actual markup is a bit trickier because I decided to allow the photo to occupy more space for larger screen resolutions
                 for medium and higher screens "-md-" it's an 8/4 ratio
                 for small screens "-sm-" it's a 9/3 ratio
                
                 for extra small screens (mobile devices), some of the content is hidden
            -->
            <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-push-3 col-md-8 col-md-push-4">
            
                <!-- define a nested grid row for the name badge rendering
                     for extra small screens, the left-hand photo is collapsed entirely and the name is displayed as a name badge with a small photo -->
                <div class="row">
                
                    <!-- define the first nested grid-column

                <h4>Why am I taking this course?</h4>
                <p>This course is an elective for the Math for Teaching program at the Harvard Extension School. While I have experience with developing dynamic web applications, I do not have experience with PHP or Git. This is a great opportunity to learn some new skills and refresh some old ones.</p>
                
                <h4>What previous experience do I have with programming?</h4>
                <p>I have experience with programming in .NET (C# and VB), Java, PeopleCode (an Oracle/PeopleSoft language similar to Java), PowerShell, JavaScript, and SQL. Over the years, I've been exposed to many programming languages and frameworks, but my primary focus has been Windows development.  I've used SVN and TFS for source control.</p>
                
                <h4>Am I working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h4>
                <p>For this class, I created a virtual machine running Windows 7. My host OS is Windows 7.</p>
                
                <h4>Anything else you should know?</h4>
                <p>Server management is not one of my greatest skills, and my Unix CL experience is limited to managing an SVN server on RedHat. It's not a primary focus of this class, but one of my goals is to get better at managing LAMP environments. I'll be looking for ways to practice this throughout the semester, and I might try to switch to a Linux OS for one of the later projects.</p>

    <!-- include the RequireJS script at the bottom of the page
         we are essentially delegating the loading of scripts to this library, which will handle all the dependencies
         the app.js file contains the configuration for the app, which will load the following libraries (in order):
         * JQuery (from a CDN)
         * JQuery (locally if the CDN is not available
         * Bootstrap (from a CDN)
         * Bootstrap (locally if the CDN is not available
         
         the benefit of using a CDN with a local fallback is that it may be faster to load scripts from a CDN
         the RequireJS plug-in handles the dependency checks nicely -->
